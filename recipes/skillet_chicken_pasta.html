        <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried basil</li>

        Steps
    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Stir in spaghettini and return
            <br>to a boil. Cook pasta until it has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, 6 to
            <br>8 minutes. Drain well and keep warm.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in tomatoes; cook
            <br>until they soften and begin to break down. Stir in garlic powder, oregano, basil,
            <br>salt, pepper, sugar, and ketchup. Heat sauce through and reserve.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat remaining 3 tablespoons oil in a separate cast iron skillet over medium
            <br>heat. Stir in chicken; cook until browned. Stir in garlic cloves; cook for 1
            <br>additional minute.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove chicken from skillet and reserve. Turn heat to high. Stir bell peppers,
            <br>onion, and mushrooms into the skillet and cook until they begin to soften. Stir in
            <br>browned chicken. Turn heat to medium and cook until chicken is no longer pink
            <br>in the center and vegetables are cooked through, about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Toss chicken and vegetables with tomato sauce and hot pasta. 
            <br>Serve sprinkled with Parmesan cheese.
        </li>
    </ol>
